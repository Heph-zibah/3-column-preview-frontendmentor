## Overview
I am excited because this is the first challenge I will pick up and see through the end. This readme.md consists the links to the solution and live URL, the process, what I built the challenge with, my lessons, the skills i will love to add, my portfolio, and acknowledgement. You are free to give a constructive criticism and of course, I am ready to be mentored.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
I sketched the design using my pen and jotter. Then I started building, first with HTML markup then CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Building this challenge made me understand the power behind using grid to style. It is simpler and makes coding easier. You can check:

```css
.cards {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    width: 100%;
    height: 500px;
}
```

i learned about responsiveness too and the fact that mobiles are diffrent and you need to work with a specific pixel to get what you want. For example:

Instead of using ```css @media (max-width: 375px){}``` for the responsiveness, i allowed my computer to deceive me into using 765px. You can imagine the frustration I went through trying to get the right padding and margin.

Sadly, I dont know how to apply the favicon image. I hope I will get to learn this.

I came to see what consitency can do. With practice and dedication, there is nothing that cant be achieved.



### Continued development


I will love to explore the world of grid more. Properties like grid-template-rows, grid-gap, grid-lines, etc. I am currently learning Javascript, so I hope I will take on challenges that test my ability in that area.
